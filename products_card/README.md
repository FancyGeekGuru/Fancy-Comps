# Animated Product Card ðŸŽ´

This is a Ready to use animated product card component made with `Reactjs`.

<br>

## How to use it as your own ? ðŸ”Ž

You can actually download the code folder. Then navigate to `components` .
There you will see `Products.js` , you can copy the whole file or just the code.

For the CSS part you need to navigate to `components` -> `styles` and there you will find `Style.css` , that is the file where the styling is done.

Finally don't forget to import the `Product.js` to your `App.js` file.

## This is how it looks ðŸ’» :
